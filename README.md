# Getting-into-MEL-and-Maya-Python
just-the beginning

These are still early days and small scripts.Posting them on github is a nice way to keep myself motivated!

1. gear.py->Maya Python plugin to automate the generation of a gear in maya.Just mention the number of teeth you want and the script does the rest.
2. disperse.py->Maya Python plugin to randomly disperse any number of particles within a user-defined range in all the three coordinates.
3. rename.py->Maya Python plugin to rename any object.Just select the object to be renamed and mention the new name.
